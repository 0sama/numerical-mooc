# Phugoid module outline

1. *Pendulum*: nonlinear model derivation; linearization; Euler's method; exact solution;
   convergence; numerical solution of nonlinear model; discretization error and
   modeling error.
2. *Phugoid*: model derivation; discretization with Euler's method; experimentation 
   (with drag).
3. Second- (or third- or fourth-) order Runge-Kutta; order of accuracy; local and global
   error; convergence rate.
4. Experimentation using Euler's method in case of no drag; midpoint method; absolute
   stability.
