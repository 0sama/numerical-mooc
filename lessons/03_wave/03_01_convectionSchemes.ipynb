Then, the [second module](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/tree/master/lessons/02_spacetime) introduced the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) with the finite difference method, where our solver stepped in both *space* and *time*.\n",

This hyperbolic equation is very interesting because the solution can develop *shocks*, or regions with very high gradient, which are difficult to resolve well with numerical methods. We will start by introducing conservation laws and how they are related to the convection equation, to then discuss different numerical schemes using the traffic flow model from Module 2's graded assessment as a motivation. The second notebook will test those schemes on Euler equations, a non-linear hyperbolic set of equations that models the behavior of inviscid, compressible flows, like air. Then, we will explore high resolution methods, to finish with some more advanced techniques that help resolve shocks better."
