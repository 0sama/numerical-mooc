      "We've reached the third lesson of the module _Riding the wave: Convection problems_, where we explore the numerical solution of conservation laws. We learned in the [first lesson](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/03_wave/03_01_conservationLaw.ipynb) how to think about conservation laws, starting with the most intuitive case: that of conservation of mass. But there are many physical quantities that can be conserved: energy, for example. Or cars on a road.\n",

      "Developing a conservation law for traffic in a one-lane roadway is fun, because we can relate to the insights it gives. We've all experienced traffic slowing down to a crawl when the density of cars gets very high, and stepping on the accelerator pedal with glee when there are no cars on the road!\n",

Not everything worked as you expected, and by now you might be realizing how some restrictions come about from the methods themselves, while others still are imposed by the models we use. This lesson will develop a better traffic model, and also show you some impressive SymPy kung fu."
