In the first notebook, we described the physics of the trajectories known as phugoids obtained from an exchange of potential and kinetic energy in an idealized motion with no drag. We gave you a neat little code to play with and plot various phugoid curves.\n",

This is a second-order ordinary differential equation, and we solved it numerically using **Euler's method**: the simplest numerical method of all. We learned about convergence and calculated the error of the numerical solution, comparing with an analytical solution. That is a good foundation!\n",
